        table_list elements are IpyTable objects.  Returns a formatted table with either a title, an image
        or an IpyTable in a cell.
    
        Formats pandas.DataFrame objects directly.  pandas.Series and individual values are first converted
        to pandas.DataFrame objects.  Strings that seem to be image file names (.jpg, etc.) capture images and
        include them in the returned HTML.  File names are assumed to be in the form of /path-to-file/filename 
        relative to the web root of the Jupyter app.
        
        There's little in the way of error checking. Failure to convert to DataFrame is silently
        caught.   Titles, if provided have to be the list-like with the same number of items as the table_list.
        The spacing kwarg represents the number of '&nbsp's inserted between objects rendered.
        
        Objects are displayed horizontally.
