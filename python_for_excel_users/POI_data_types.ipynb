    "Under the hood pandas builds on Python's NumPy library, which supports vectorized calculations.  NumPy, in turn, relies on your C compiler's support for data types.  Your C compiler works in conjunction with your CPU to figure out just what data it can support.   Fortunately, most users can be blissfully unaware of the complexities the interested few can dive in and optimize their operations.\n",
    "\n",
