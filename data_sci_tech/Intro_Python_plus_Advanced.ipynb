This is especially valuable when adding complex libraries such as NumPy, which can take hours to get right.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this course, we’ll use the Anaconda distribution. This supports all sorts of data science and visualization packages that we’ll touch on in the advanced course, along with Python virtual environments “right out of the box.” You can install it by browsing to this sight and following\n",

IDLE works and works well, but for serious work I much prefer a more fully-functional environment such as PyCharm, WingIDE, or VSCode with the Python plug-in. If you’re accustomed to Eclipse, you could use the PyDev plug-in[1]. A light-weight debugger, Spyder, comes packaged with Anaconda. If you want to use Wing, you can download a full-on Professional version (free for 30 days)[2]. You have many options.\n",

It can easily perform the same sort of analysis possible with big data analytical tools like Hadoop, but just not at the same scale. (Hadoop has its own way to manage workload and file systems – that's where its real magic lies).\n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell, a map operation is one that iterates through a bunch of objects and does the same thing to each one. A reduce operation sifts through the mapped objects and filters out the \"good stuff.\" Generally speaking, the **map** function is run once then sifted through multiple times by different reducers.\n",

The result is another iterable of only those that have been deemed **True**. The syntax is identical to that of **map**:\n",

This means they don't process all the data at once. Instead, they proceed one step at a time through their task, then only when requested. This sort of \"lazy execution\" makes handling of even large data sets possible because only the bits of it that are being processed need be in the memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python also has a **reduce** method – it works pretty much like **map**, except the operations defined in the function are applied cumulatively.

Let's say you have a huge data file that you read into a Python array for processing. If the file starts out life as a comma-delimited file, say, reading it is expensive because the interpreter has to figure out how large every piece is, convert it to a numeric data type, and put it into memory.\n",

    "Encapsulation is the notion that there is one and only one way to access an object. \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is that objects are atomic, but they have a specific context – and you're supposed to interact with them \"by the rules.\" For example, some languages use getters and setters to interact with a class' attributes and enforce that interaction. That way there are specific points of contact that serve as gateways. As another example, methods (\"verbs\") within a class are only accessible within the context of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python naturally supports encapsulation by \"hiding\" variables within the namespaces of different structures like functions, inner functions, classes, and modules. A further level of control can be exercised by employing \"getters\" and \"setters\" to control access to instance variables. Note that Python has no such requirement but sometimes it's a good idea to lock things down further.\n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish this, Python employs a special \"decorator[65]\" called **property**. Decorators are methods that take the decorated object as an argument – essentially swallowing the decorated object, much as the print function can swallow another function using its output as an argument as in this example:\n",

    "For this chapter, we’ll work with Python’s **sqlite3** module. It\n",
    "requires no setup, definition of an administrator, or anything else – it\n",
    "comes “batteries included”. Also, since it’s part of standard Python you\n",
    "can rely on it working on any system with Python installed. If you later\n",
    "choose to use another database – no worries. You’ll need to find and\n",
    "install a piece of middleware called a “connector” and, of course, the\n",
    "database software. What you learn here will most apply to the\n",
    "alternative tools. and your interactions with the objects it provides\n",
    "will be nearly-identical those you have with **SQLite**. Switching\n",
    "should be easy\\[48\\].\n",
