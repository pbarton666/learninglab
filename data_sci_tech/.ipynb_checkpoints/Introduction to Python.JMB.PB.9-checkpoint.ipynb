    "The Python Environment\n",
    "----------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "You should already have Python installed on your machine. If not, no worries. You could go ahead and install a fresh Python distribution and an IDE (integrated development environment).\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, it’s possible to download, compile, and install Python. If you’re ever interested, downloads are available directly from the official Python web site:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.python.org/downloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "This being said, there are distributions such as EnThought and Anaconda which offer integrated package management that allows easy access to extended libraries and their sometimes extensive/tedious dependencies. This is especially valuable when adding complex libraries such as NumPy, which can take hours to get right.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this course, we’ll use the Anaconda distribution. This supports all sorts of data science and visualization packages that we’ll touch on in the advanced course, along with Python virtual environments “right out of the box.” You can install it by browsing to this sight and following\n",
    "the instructions to get the 64-bit version for Python 3. \n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.anaconda.com/download/\n",
    "\n",
    "The “official” IDE for Python is called IDLE. It provides a rudimentary and very light weight debugger and file manager. IDLE works and works well, but for serious work I much prefer a more fully-functional environment such as PyCharm, WingIDE, or VSCode with the Python plug-in. If you’re accustomed to Eclipse, you could use the PyDev plug-in[1]. A light-weight debugger, Spyder, comes packaged with Anaconda. If you want to use Wing, you can download a full-on Professional version (free for 30 days)[2]. You have many options.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Start ... Control Panel... System ... Advanced System Settings ...\n",
    "Environment Variables**\n",
    "\n",
    "Then edit PATH by appending the binary directory. You have to be a bit careful. Add a semicolon, no spaces, and the name of the new directory with no trailing slash. Something like:\n",

    "After we assigned it a name, we then called it by name and it responded. It happened to respond with its value, but not all objects do that. The response is built into the object as its **\\_\\_repr\\_\\_** method, which is executed when you type the name. When you make your own classes later on, you’ll be able to make it say something like “I’m 1, and I’m a Leo”, or anything else you like. The **int** object simply replies with a parsimonious string representation of itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next bit, invoking the top level function **id** provides a unique descriptor of the object. Under the hood, it’s just the location in memory where the object resides (that’s how it’s guaranteed to be unique – no two objects can occupy the same space at the same time).\n",
    "\n",
    "We’re pretty sure what type of object one is, but we can ask to be sure using the **type** method. In this case, we learn that it’s an **int** object (not an “integer”). In fact, **int** is the name of a built-in function and already reserved by Python. We can use it with the **isinstance** method to verify its type. This can become important – for instance, we might want to check whether an object is a number before attempting to do math with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the really useful aspects of Python is that objects come to us already endowed with properties and already knowing how to do type-appropriate tricks. More properly these are called **attributes** and **methods** (“nouns” and “verbs”). "

    " Python's Take on Map, Reduce and Filter\n",
    "---------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has some limited built-in capability to handle map/reduce operations. It can easily perform the same sort of analysis possible with big data analytical tools like Hadoop, but just not at the same scale. (Hadoop has its own way to manage workload and file systems – that's where its real magic lies).\n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell, a map operation is one that iterates through a bunch of objects and does the same thing to each one. A reduce operation sifts through the mapped objects and filters out the \"good stuff.\" Generally speaking, the **map** function is run once then sifted through multiple times by different reducers.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement mapping in python, we can use the **map** function. Its syntax is straightforward:\n",
    "\n",
    "mapped\\_data = map (\\<processing\\_function\\>, \\<iterable\\>)\n",
    "\n",
    "To filter data, we can call upon the **filter** function. It works pretty much like map, but the processing filter passed judgment on each element of the iterable objects by evaluating it **True** or **False**.  The result is another iterable of only those that have been deemed **True**. The syntax is identical to that of **map**:\n",
    "\n",
    "filtered\\_data = filter(\\<processing\\_function\\>, \\<iterable\\>)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how you might use **map** and **filter** to find even sums of integers provided as **tuples**. These methods are interesting because they each take two arguments: incoming data and the name of the routine to process the data. Each returns a generator-like object. This means they don't process all the data at once. Instead, they proceed one step at a time through their task, then only when requested. This sort of \"lazy execution\" makes handling of even large data sets possible because only the bits of it that are being processed need be in the memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python also has a **reduce** method – it works pretty much like **map**, except the operations defined in the function are applied cumulatively.  Note that it's implemented using a **lambda** expression[45] (an anonymous \"one liner\" function that can be used in place of a standard function)."

    "\n",
    "Encapsulation is the notion that there is one and only one way to access an object. \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is that objects are atomic, but they have a specific context – and you're supposed to interact with them \"by the rules.\" For example, some languages use getters and setters to interact with a class' attributes and enforce that interaction. That way there are specific points of contact that serve as gateways. As another example, methods (\"verbs\") within a class are only accessible within the context of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python naturally supports encapsulation by \"hiding\" variables within the namespaces of different structures like functions, inner functions, classes, and modules. A further level of control can be exercised by employing \"getters\" and \"setters\" to control access to instance variables. Note that Python has no such requirement but sometimes it's a good idea to lock things down further.\n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish this, Python employs a special \"decorator[65]\" called **property**. Decorators are methods that take the decorated object as an argument – essentially swallowing the decorated object, much as the print function can swallow another function using its output as an argument as in this example:\n",

If you go on to use elements from Python's scientific stack e.g., **numpy**, you'll be using the numeric types supported by your C compiler. These will typically be limited to 64 bits in modern machines. Cf.  https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/user/basics.types.html\n",
    "\n",
    "[6] Note all the things we did NOT have to do: declare the looping variable s; find the length of the object; move the pointer along the sequence; ensure we don't run the pointer \"off the edge\" of the object.  This is all handled by methods defined as part of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "[7] An \"indented suite\" is just a \\$20 word for all the lines of code beneath a header (the **for** statement in this case) that's indented the same number of spaces. This is considered the \"code block\" associated with the header.\n",
    "\n",
    "[8] We're going into quite a bit of detail on string objects here – partly because they're might useful and partly because they are exemplars of all other Python objects you'll encounter.\n",
    "\n",
    "[9] You can think of opposing parentheses as the \"execution operator\", much as + is (usually) the \"addition operator\". Note that the function won't execute without the ():\n",

    "[10] A **list** is a built-in Python object. It's an ordered sequence that may contain heterogenous elements, something like: \\[ 'one', 2, 3.0, (4 + 5j) \\] Note the square brackets. More on the **list** object later.\n",
    "\n",
    "[11] An \"iterable object\" is something you can use a for or next operation on – it knows how to loop over itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "[12] With no arguments, it splits on anything in the same time zone as a white space (tabs, new line characters, and white spaces).\n",
    "\n",
    "[13] A **tuple** is the same as a list except it's \"immutable\" (unchangeable). It has parenthesis, something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ( 'one', 2, 3.0, (4 + 5j) )\n",
    "\n",
    "[14] The opposite of **chr** is **ord**. Thus **chr**(90) is 'Z' and **ord**('Z') is 90.\n",
    "\n",
    "[15] **None** is an honest-to-goodness Python object. It doesn't do much, but you can assign a name to it and use the name as you would that of any other variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "[16] You'll find **in** used in several contexts (as with the **for** statement). It invokes the **\\_\\_contains\\_\\_** method to determine membership.\n",
    "\n",
    "[17] **replace** changes all occurrences by default. If you provide an optional parameter count, you can limit the number of replacements:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> 'aaa'.replace('a', 'A', 2)\n",
    "        'AAa'\n",
    "\n",
    "[18] The **lstrip** method removes whitespaces on the left, **rstrip** on the right, and **strip** from both ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "[19] This section can be skipped without loss of continuity, but may be worth a quick glance.\n",
    "\n",
    "[20] Back in the day, one had to provide more specific placeholders like %s, %i, and %f for strings, integers and floating point numbers. In fact, Python will still accept these \"legacy\" specifications. This works:\n",
    "\n",
    "        >>> \"%s %s\" %('Hey', 'Joe!')\n",
    "        'Hey Joe!\n",
    "\n",
    "[21] The most common alignment choices are left (\\<), right (\\>), or center(^).\n",
    "\n",
    "[22] <https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-string-syntax> It may be well worth your while to take a moment with the docs to get an idea for the breadth of options available. Dozens of examples appear at the bottom that will serve as recipes for complex formatting chores.\n",
    "\n",
    "[23] \"Unpacking\" is a common Python idiom – you can create new names and assign members of a sequence as their values using this sort of shorthand (works on lists, tuples, strings, etc.):\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> first, second = \"AB\"\n",
    "    >>> print(first, second)\n",

    "[25] As a consequence, be sure to put general \"catch all\" tests at the bottom of your block – otherwise they could block execution of the contents of more specific tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "[26] You might want to step through this **while** loop a line at a time in a debugger, as well as the others encountered in this chapter, to observe which lines get executed – and in what order.\n",
    "\n",
    "[27] Python supports lots of permutations of this including -= \\*= /= and %=.\n",
    "\n",
    "[28] You can think of a binary shift as increasing or decreasing a binary number by a power of 2. In the base 10 world it's like going 1.2 \\* 10\\*\\*2 = 120 … 1.2 \\* 10\\*\\*3 = 1200 … 1.2 \\* 10\\*\\*4 = 12000. As you increase to power of 10, you just tack on a zero because you're shifting the \"1.2\" by increasing orders of magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "[29] A **set** is a collection of zero or more unique objects. More on the **set** object later.\n",
    "\n",
    "[30] This is convenient, but has performance issues at scale – the interpreter has to be prepared to constantly adjust things, and that means lots of relatively expensive memory allocation operations. If you're considering a project that could deal with large amounts of data consider using immutable sequences (**tuples** and **strings**) where possible and/or objects that impose heterogenous elements e.g., **array.array** or **numpy.ndarray** objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "[31] It's helpful to think of the \"stop\" parameter like a real-world stop sign. You don't roll through it, but stop before it. Though a bit strange at first, this specification is handy because iterable\\[:2\\] and iterable\\[2:\\] are complementary \"halves\" of the entire object.\n",
    "\n",
    "[32] The collections library contains some great tools not covered here including **defaultdict** (a **dict**-like object that automatically installs a new key:default\\_value pair if the key doesn't exist) and **deque** (a double-ended queue useful for managing processes and threads).\n",
    "\n",
    "[33] Generally a hash is a computer science term for the eponymous data structure. There's a very approachable article in Wikipedia, in case you're interested: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash\\_function\n",
    "\n",
    "[34] If you accidentally use a mutable (changeable) object you'll get a nearly-indecipherable error message, something like: builtins.TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'\n",
    "\n",
    "[35] You may have noted that Python objects don't have destructor methods, as you find in many other languages. The **del** method is a general purpose tool for destroying unwanted objects. You typically don't need to worry about this because Python has built-in \"garbage collection\". Objects that are dereferenced get destroyed automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "[36] NB **sort** is a method belonging to the **list** object. It's an \"in-place\" operation – that means that the elements are simply shifted around and no new object is created. As a result, it returns a **None** object. The **sorted** function is a built-in that will work on any iterable. It creates and returns a new **list** object.\n",
    "\n",
    "[37] It's easy to build a list comprehension if you do it in stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "        [ ]                              #empty list\n",
    "        [ for i in range(3) ]            #add an iterating expression\n",
    "        [ i for i in range(3) ]          #add the thing that goes into the list\n",
    "        [ i for i in range(3) if i %2 ]  #add a filter (anything that produces a Boolean)\n",
    "\n",
    "[38] Cf. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess\\_symbols\\_in\\_Unicode\n",
    "\n",
    "[39] Python 2.x can use Unicode, but it's \"by request only\".\n",
    "\n",
    "[40] You can view the global namespace (really a **dict** mapping names and values) using **globals()**. In some IDEs the function names are not shown in stack data.\n",
    "\n",
    "[41] You can view the local namespace using **locals()**. The local namespace will change as the execution moves from function to function.\n",
    "\n",
    "[42] You may want to experiment by removing and replacing the comment in **setStar**.\n",
    "\n",
    "[43] Note the use of the keyword **pass**. This is a placeholder whose only job is to take up space – enough to establish indentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "[44] In some languages, like Java, functions don't really have a meaning outside the context of a containing class; they're known as \"class methods\".\n",
    "\n",
    "[45] Simple **lambda** functions can add readability to your code because they can be defined geographically close to where they're being applied. Though they're only \"one liners\" they can be arbitrarily complex and really difficult for your teammates to figure out. Sometimes it's much more transparent to use a traditional function.\n",
    "\n",
    "[46] You can check an annotated version to find out: py\\_function\\_7\\_upgraded.py\n",
    "\n",
    "[47] As an aside (just for fun) the epoch \"odometer\" will \"roll over\" for 32 bit Linux systems on January 19, 2038. This could be interesting if any of these machines still exist. If you have a 64-bit system, you can relax. The rollover won't happen until sometime in the year 292,277,026,596.\n",
    "\n",
    "[48] Cf. https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html\n",
    "\n",
    "[49] There is also an \"opposite\" method that will convert a string into a **datetime** object using the same codes – it's called **strptime.**\n",
    "\n",
    "[50] http://strftime.org/\n",
    "\n",
    "[51] If you get serious about wrangling dates you'll want to consider using **pandas**. The basic **pandas** object Series is essentially a **list** on steroids. Like a **list** it has a 0-based integer index.  But you can \"bolt on\" an index of any other data type, including dates.  When you do, pandas knows how to \"stretch\" it from days to weeks, interpolate missing values any way you ask, etc. It is aware of business days, holidays, etc. Well worth the investment to learn, IMHO.\n",
    "\n",
    "[52] You might want to use help() on the **TextCalendar** object produced in this script. It knows how to return specific months, week, or years as printable calendar snippets, as iterators, or as lists of **datetime** objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "[53] The **os.path** package has several useful methods for teasing apart path names, joining them with the correct separators, determining if specific file system objects exist, etc. The **shutil** library has several methods for working with macro-scale file system manipulations like moving entire directory trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "[54] If you're running this code in a debugger like WingIDE, the debugger may stop execution inappropriately when an exception is encountered. If this happens, ask the debugger to ignore this exception.  In Wing, there's a checkbox in the Exceptions tab for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "[55] https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html\\#exception-hierarchy\n",
    "\n",
    "[56] It's worthwhile taking a quick look at the namespace of the traceback library – it has many tools you can use when doing text-only debugging (these get wrapped up in tools like Exceptions and Call Stack when using an IDE).\n",
    "\n",
    "[57] There is a more elaborate example in py\\_handler\\_practice.py, in case you're interested in playing around with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "[58] The 'r' mode is the default. Strictly speaking you don't need to specify it.\n",
    "\n",
    "[59] Alternatively, you can use the **subprocess** library. This give you the ability to spawn new processes with which you can invoke bash scripts, execute system programs, and anything else you might do at the command line. For instance, you can go:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> import subprocess\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> subprocess.call('dir', shell=True) \\#subprocess.call('ls -l', shell=True)\n",
