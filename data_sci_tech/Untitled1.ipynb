    "-   What the heck is Python and where did it come from?\n",

    "work with and very forgiving to the beginner. You can’t break Python. It\n",
    "talks to you. In fact, it’s downright loquacious. You can ask it\n",
    "questions and it (usually) provides sensible answers. And when it\n",
    "doesn’t, there are hundreds of thousands of great resources available\n",

    "The Python Environment\n",
    "----------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "You should already have Python installed on your machine. If not, no\n",
    "worries. You could go ahead and install a fresh Python distribution and\n",
    "an IDE (integrated development environment).\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, it’s possible to download, compile, and install Python. If you’re\n",
    "ever interested, downloads are available directly from the official\n",
    "Python web site:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.python.org/downloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "This being said, there are distributions such as EnThought and Anaconda\n",
    "which offer integrated package management that allows easy access to\n",
    "extended libraries and their sometimes extensive/tedious dependencies.\n",
    "This is especially valuable when adding complex libraries such as NumPy,\n",
    "which can take hours to get right.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this course, we’ll use the Anaconda distribution. This supports all\n",
    "sorts of data science and visualization packages that we’ll touch on in\n",
    "the advanced course, along with Python virtual environments “right out\n",
    "of the box.” You can install it by browsing to this sight and following\n",
    "the instructions to get the 64-bit version for Python 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.anaconda.com/download/\n",
    "\n",
    "The “official” IDE for Python is called IDLE. It provides a rudimentary\n",
    "and very light weight debugger and file manager. IDLE works and works\n",
    "well, but for serious work I much prefer a more fully-functional\n",
    "environment such as PyCharm or WingIDE. If you’re accustomed to Eclipse,\n",
    "you could use the PyDev plug-in[1]. A light-weight debugger, Spyder,\n",
    "comes packaged with Anaconda. If you want to use Wing, you can download\n",
    "a full-on Professional version (free for 30 days)[2]. You have many\n",
    "options.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses environment variables to help it work and play well with the\n",
    "operating system (OS). The most important of these are PATH and\n",
    "PYTHONPATH.\n",
    "\n",
    "PATH contains the directories your OS will search when looking for a\n",
    "particular application. In order for Python to “just work” when you\n",
    "type:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\$ python\n",
    "\n",
    "… you have to include Python’s binary (executable) directory in the PATH\n",
    "variable. That’s where python.exe lives. On a Windows system, you can do\n",
    "that by clicking:  \n",
    "**Start ... Control Panel... System ... Advanced System Settings ...\n",
    "Environment Variables**\n",
    "\n",
    "Then edit PATH by appending the binary directory. You have to be a bit\n",
    "careful. Add a semicolon, no spaces, and the name of the new directory\n",
    "with no trailing slash. Something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\<existing path\\>;c:\\\\Path\\\\To\\\\Directory\n",
    "\n",
    "On a Linux system, you can simply add an export to \\~/.bashrc:\n",
    "\n",
    "Export PATH = \\$PATH:/path/to/directory\n",
    "\n",
    "PYTHONPATH works the same way PATH does, but it’s used internally by\n",
    "Python to search for modules (libraries, for instance) that you’ll want\n",
    "to import into your code’s namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you make the necessary changes to your environment variables,\n",
    "you’ll need to start a new terminal to apply them (or run source\n",
    "\\~/.bashrc in Linux).\n",
    "\n",
    "Some Basics \n",
    "-----------\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s have a quick look at some Python concepts. We’ll cover all these\n",
    "in more depth later, but we’ll put them on the table early.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an amazingly simple language from a syntax perspective.\n",
    "Believe it or not, there are only 33 keywords only a few of which are\n",
    "exotic. Here’s a list[3]:\n",

    "\n",
    "If you are ever uncertain about whether a variable name you’re\n",
    "considering is a keyword (or otherwise known to the interpreter), you\n",
    "can just type it into a command line. If the interpreter “yells at you”,\n",
    "you can choose another name.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few other things to know:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Case matters – Python is case sensitive\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Indentation matters – Python doesn’t rely on brackets or braces\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Whitespace typically does not matter\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Help is just a few keystrokes away – just type “help”\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what is Python, anyway?\n",
    "\n",
    "-   A **high-level**, **object oriented** (each object has its own\n",
    "    repertoire of nouns and verbs, and they can borrow from and build on\n",
    "    each other) **interpreted** language (“just in time” compilation).\n",
    "\n",
    "-   You can think of it a giant wrapper around hundreds of thousands of\n",
    "    lines of C and C++ libraries, each providing consistent APIs\n",
    "    (Application Programming Interfaces) so everything has the same look\n",
    "    and feel.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Created by **Guido van Rossum**, a great fan of **Monty Python**, in\n",
    "    the late 1990s as a successor to the ABC language, with significant\n",
    "    support from **DARPA**. (That’s Guido holding a beer in the photo\n",
    "    below.)\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Highly extensible to applications such as GIS (pyqgis), scientific\n",
    "    programming (numpy), visualization (matplotlib), and many other\n",
    "    domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Python is operating system agnostic, and runs equally well on\n",
    "    Windows, Linux, Raspberry Pi, and Mac systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has been around since 1994 and has undergone several\n",
    "transformations. Most notably, Python evolved from 2.7 to 3.0 in 2008,\n",
    "implementing Unicode characters and addressing some lingering structural\n",
    "concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are plenty of solid applications written in 2.7 in the world, but\n",
    "most newer developments have shifted to Python 3. You should be aware\n",
    "that there are enough substantive differences between 2.x and 3.x that\n",
    "code written against one version is not wholly compatible with the\n",
    "other.\n",

    " Python’s Take on Map, Reduce and Filter\n",
    "---------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has some limited built-in capability to handle map/reduce\n",
    "operations. It can easily perform the same sort of analysis possible\n",
    "with big data analytical tools like Hadoop, but just not at the same\n",
    "scale. (Hadoop has its own way to manage workload and file systems –\n",
    "that’s where its real magic lies).\n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell, a map operation is one that iterates through a bunch of\n",
    "objects and does the same thing to each one. A reduce operation sifts\n",
    "through the mapped objects and filters out the “good stuff.” Generally\n",
    "speaking, the **map** function is run once then sifted through multiple\n",
    "times by different reducers.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement mapping in python, we can use the **map** function. Its\n",
    "syntax is straightforward:\n",
    "\n",
    "mapped\\_data = map (\\<processing\\_function\\>, \\<iterable\\>)\n",
    "\n",
    "To filter data, we can call upon the **filter** function. It works\n",
    "pretty much like map, but the processing filter passed judgment on each\n",
    "element of the iterable objects by evaluating it **True** or **False**.\n",
    "The result is another iterable of only those that have been deemed\n",
    "**True**. The syntax is identical to that of **map**:\n",
    "\n",
    "filtered\\_data = filter(\\<processing\\_function\\>, \\<iterable\\>)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s an example of how you might use **map** and **filter** to find\n",
    "even sums of integers provided as **tuples**. These methods are\n",
    "interesting because they each take two arguments: incoming data and the\n",
    "name of the routine to process the data. Each returns a generator-like\n",
    "object. This means they don’t process all the data at once. Instead,\n",
    "they proceed one step at a time through their task, then only when\n",
    "requested. This sort of “lazy execution” makes handling of even large\n",
    "data sets possible because only the bits of it that are being processed\n",
    "need be in the memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python also has a **reduce** method – it works pretty much like **map**,\n",
    "except the operations defined in the function are applied cumulatively.\n",
    "Note that it’s implemented using a **lambda** expression[45] (an\n",

    "    (Linux-like) systems, the epoch began on January 1, 1970. For\n",

    "-   However, your computer (or AWS slice, or server) may “think” in\n",

    "    county-by-county, and state-by-state. “Summer time” in Europe and\n",
    "    elsewhere doesn’t necessarily synch with U.S. daylight savings time.\n",
    "    UTC is reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   There are two “flavors” of elapsed time available. One is told by\n",
    "    the clock on your wall – it’s an objective measure of the time you\n",

    "-----------\n",
    "\n",
    "­The easiest form of an exception is the **assert** statement. Its\n",
    "syntax is pretty easy:\n",
    "\n",
    "assert \\<some statement\\>\n",
    "\n",
    "<table>\n",

    "<p>AssertionError</p></td>\n",
    "</tr>\n",
    "</tbody>\n",
    "</table>\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, the interpreter generates an **AssertionError** (which\n",
    "is a type of exception) when statement evaluated is **False**. This sort\n",
    "of a blunt approach that doesn’t yield much actionable information, but\n",
    "it is a “quick and dirty” way to identify a problem during execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "As this stands, finding a **False** condition basically crashes your\n",
    "program – something you usually don’t want to happen. So how can you\n",
    "handle this more smoothly? You can tell the interpreter what to do in\n",
    "specific circumstances using a **try** / **except** block. Here’s how:\n",
    "\n",
    "<table>\n",

    "</tr>\n",

    "form that can be saved to the hard drive. The **pickle** methods work in\n",
    "byte streams while the **json** methods work in plain text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why would you want to work with bytes? For one thing, you can store your\n",
    "code very compactly. More importantly, you can stream byte code between\n",
    "applications or computers whereas you can’t do that with Python objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another advantage is that serialized data is in a very predictable\n",
    "format. That makes life very easy on the interpreter. Let’s say you have\n",
    "a huge data file that you read into a Python array for processing. If\n",
    "the file starts out life as a comma-delimited file, say, reading it is\n",
    "expensive because the interpreter has to figure out how large every\n",
    "piece is, convert it to a numeric data type, and put it into memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "If, on the other hand, the interpreter knows the geometry of the data\n",
    "and can “mechanically” ingest the pieces of it, very little processing\n",
    "has to happen – it just needs to be loaded into memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "In my experience a 2MB, csv-formatted file takes around 30 seconds to\n",
