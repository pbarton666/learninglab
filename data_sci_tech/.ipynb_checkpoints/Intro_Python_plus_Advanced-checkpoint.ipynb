This is especially valuable when adding complex libraries such as NumPy, which can take hours to get right.\n",

IDLE works and works well, but for serious work I much prefer a more fully-functional environment such as PyCharm, WingIDE, or VSCode with the Python plug-in. If you’re accustomed to Eclipse, you could use the PyDev plug-in[1]. A light-weight debugger, Spyder, comes packaged with Anaconda. If you want to use Wing, you can download a full-on Professional version (free for 30 days)[2]. You have many options.\n",

As a result, different teams can work on the individual functions and atomic tests can be written against the capabilities promised by each function.

    " Python's Take on Map, Reduce and Filter\n",
    "---------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has some limited built-in capability to handle map/reduce operations. It can easily perform the same sort of analysis possible with big data analytical tools like Hadoop, but just not at the same scale. (Hadoop has its own way to manage workload and file systems – that's where its real magic lies).\n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell, a map operation is one that iterates through a bunch of objects and does the same thing to each one. A reduce operation sifts through the mapped objects and filters out the \"good stuff.\" Generally speaking, the **map** function is run once then sifted through multiple times by different reducers.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement mapping in python, we can use the **map** function. Its syntax is straightforward:\n",
    "\n",
    "mapped\\_data = map (\\<processing\\_function\\>, \\<iterable\\>)\n",
    "\n",
    "To filter data, we can call upon the **filter** function. It works pretty much like map, but the processing filter passed judgment on each element of the iterable objects by evaluating it **True** or **False**.  The result is another iterable of only those that have been deemed **True**. The syntax is identical to that of **map**:\n",
    "\n",
    "filtered\\_data = filter(\\<processing\\_function\\>, \\<iterable\\>)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how you might use **map** and **filter** to find even sums of integers provided as **tuples**. These methods are interesting because they each take two arguments: incoming data and the name of the routine to process the data. Each returns a generator-like object. This means they don't process all the data at once. Instead, they proceed one step at a time through their task, then only when requested. This sort of \"lazy execution\" makes handling of even large data sets possible because only the bits of it that are being processed need be in the memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python also has a **reduce** method – it works pretty much like **map**, except the operations defined in the function are applied cumulatively.  Note that it's implemented using a **lambda** expression[45] (an anonymous \"one liner\" function that can be used in place of a standard function)."

    "Pickle\n",
    "-------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports a native whole-object serialization protocol called **pickle.**  It can encode and decode intact objects like functions and classes into a form that can be saved to the hard drive. The **pickle** methods work in byte streams.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why would you want to work with bytes? For one thing, you can store your code very compactly. More importantly, you can stream byte code between applications or computers whereas you can't do that with Python objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another advantage is that serialized data is in a very predictable format. That makes life very easy on the interpreter. Let's say you have a huge data file that you read into a Python array for processing. If the file starts out life as a comma-delimited file, say, reading it is expensive because the interpreter has to figure out how large every piece is, convert it to a numeric data type, and put it into memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "If, on the other hand, the interpreter knows the geometry of the data and can \"mechanically\" ingest the pieces of it, very little processing has to happen – it just needs to be loaded into memory.\n",
    "\n",

That way there are specific points of contact that serve as gateways. As another example, methods (\"verbs\") within a class are only accessible within the context of the class.\n",

Note that Python has no such requirement but sometimes it's a good idea to lock things down further.\n",
